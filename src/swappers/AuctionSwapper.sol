/**
 *   @title AuctionSwapper
 *   @author yearn.fi
 *   @dev Helper contract for a strategy to use dutch auctions for token sales.
 *
 *   This contract is meant to be inherited by a V3 strategy in order
 *   to easily integrate dutch auctions into a contract for token swaps.
 *
 *   The strategist will need to implement a way to call `_enableAuction`
 *   for an token pair they want to use, or a setter to manually set the
 *   `auction` contract.
 *
 *   The contract comes with all of the needed function to act as a `hook`
 *   contract for the specific auction contract with the ability to override
 *   any of the functions to implement custom hooks.
 *
 *   NOTE: If any hooks are not desired, the strategist should also
 *   implement a way to call the {setHookFlags} on the auction contract
 *   to avoid unnecessary gas for unused functions.
